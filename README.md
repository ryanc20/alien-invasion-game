# alien-invasion-game
Alien Invasion Game written in Python.

The game was completed following a tutorial from the book Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Python by Eric Matthes. I was able to complete the game following the instruction of the book and have added improvements to the game to practice using Python and Python libraries.

The current version is incomplete and I plan to make several changes.
